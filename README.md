## How does it work?

Nitroboost works by first generating gift links discord.gift/ and generating a number of numbers and letters at the end
It will then check the codes by then using 2 methods of link scanning to check the codes

The first method is Proxy checking, this will load every URL with a proxy server and check if the code is valid or invalid
The second method is Server checking, this will call upon the IP of discord hosting servers and gives a reply to see if the code is valid to the server or not

## Multi-Scanning
> SPEEDNITRO runs 3 scans for every byte file
